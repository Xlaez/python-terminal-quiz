# python-terminal-quiz
<p>The quiz data has very limited quiz questions in it, could be modified for more fun</p>
<p>When the Quiz data is out of questions, rather than end the request , it displays an error. I beleive this is caused by a typo</p>
<p>You can debug it for better experience</p>
<p>Quiz_data.py is the container for quiz data to be loaded</p>
<p>Of course you can tweak the app from functioning as a true/ false app to something with answer</p>
